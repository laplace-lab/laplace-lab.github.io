	<h1>Laplace Lab Manual</h1>
	<p>
	  Here you can find information about working at the Laplace Lab. Email <a href="mailto:fbb2116@columbia.edu">Breck</a> if you need help.

	<h2>Communications</h2>
	<p>
	  Due to COVID-19 we have not been having face-to-face meetings. Ways of reaching others:
	  <ul>
	    <li>We do have a group email <a href="mailto:laplace-lab@googlegroups.com">laplace-lab@googlegroups.com</a>. Anyone in the lab can post, email <a href="mailto:fbb2116@columbia.edu">Breck</a> to get added/removed.</li>
	  
	  <li>Slack Invite: Our slack channel invite is: <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/laplace-lab/shared_invite/zt-gagrlv4w-GHfBz4ljB1jnMM3qcNXEkA">https://join.slack.com/t/laplace-lab/shared_invite/zt-g2bvytqs-EjDuQTTJ59r73oX2~p07aw</a>. This is new territory for us, please be patient. </li>
	</ul>		    
	  <h2>Google Drive Documents</h2>
	  We usually have between 5-10 sources of funding. Many of them require annual reports which in turn means help from lab members. The documents include proposal drafts, status reports, deliverables and so on. Access to these folders is restricted so email <a href="mailto:fbb2116@columbia.edu">Breck</a> if you need help or access. Your Columbia university email is the likely email used to provide access.
	  <ul>

	  </ul>

	  <h2>ISERP information</h2>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Most of us are employed by the Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy (<a href="http://iserp.columbia.edu/">ISERP</a>).</li>
	    <li>The administrative offices (Suite 370) are difficult to find, watch video on the page: <a href="http://iserp.columbia.edu/about/directions-iserps-spaces">ISERP directions</a>. It has a groovy sound track.</li>
	      <li>Useful email aliases include:
	      <ul>

	    </li>
	    <li>Reimbursement for travel or other work expenses involves a <a href="http://iserp.columbia.edu/business-office/TBER-form">TBER form</a>. Do not let expenses get too old (120 days?) or they will tax the rembursement. </li>
